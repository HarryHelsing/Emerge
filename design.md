Aesthetics: Top down, low res, grid-based.
Gameplay: Realtime-ish, strategy, exploration, Roguelike, semi-cosy game... What a combo!

## Concept
The Five Worlds have lost their way.
The Noble Beasts perform a ritual, summoning the dark amorphous blob, which is you!
Venture into the ever-shifting wilds, where strange creatures run rampant.
Observe and learn their patterns, some may be slain, some may wish to accompany you home to aid you.
Just as you learn to become in sync with the worlds, the worlds will be in sync with you.

## Mechanics
# Controls
Move in four directions through the grid.
Utilise one of four active abilities (Agility, Melee, Range, & Summoning -there is also vitality)
The world updates every three seconds, or when you make a move.
Decisions must be made swiftly, or the world will march on without you.
But conversely, if you wish to move swiftly, there's no need to wait, though remember the world will move in step with you!
Agility is the ability of enhanced movement.
Melee is the ability for a variety of close range attacks.
Range is the ability for a variety of long range attacks.
Summoning is the ability for summoning traps, creatures, debuffs and buffs.
