# Rough Plans and Ideas

## Creating Enemy Creatures
*Stage One*
- Spawn enemies periodically
- Move enemies to the player periodically
- Create logic for enemy movement so they do not overlap

*Stage Two*
- Allow enemies to damage player back

## Creating Global Movement Logic
- Create a logic so when the player moves the world moves once
- Create timer that resets every three seconds to force a move if not taken in that time

## Creating Health Bars and Timer bars
- Design a health bar that matches player health
- Design timer bar that matches player time before turn end

### Braindump
Learn to use states for advanced enemy ai, events for performance

### ToDo:
- Stop resize fn running every frame
