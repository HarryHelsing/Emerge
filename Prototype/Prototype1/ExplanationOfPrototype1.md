## What is going on here?
At this stage of development I hadn't really gotten my head around using git properly.
I was just uploading files to github as a way to preserve my code, but missing out key
files.
With Prototype 2 I learned how to use git from the command line, which is why it
is set up correctly.
If you want to get something resembling my first prototype you may take the assets from
Prototype 2 as well as the Cargo.toml and compile it. (obviously structure the directories
as they are in Prototype 2)
