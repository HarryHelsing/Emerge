# Explanations of Prototype Versions
## Prototype 1
### Tech demo
Mostly just a chance to try out Bevy, try out coding some of the basics to test things out.

## Prototype 2
### Gameplay demo
A chance to test out gameplay mechanics in a rough form.

- *not done* Create Rhythm Movement system(redesign has happened, rhythm mechanics have been replaces with short timer design)
- *done* Create Player Character
- *done* Create Enemies

- *done* Create Movement Logic
- *done* Create Attack Logic
- *done* Create Tilemap Function

**Notes**
It's probably important to finish this demo and test the global time mechanic before moving on. That being said don't both fleshing it out beyond that.


## Prototype 3
### Polish Demo
This prototype is going to be an attempt to polish a very small section of the game.
By doing so I hope to understand deeper the direction of the game and learn what sort of changes may be needed to take it in the desired direction.

### ToDo for Prototype
