### Explanations of Prototype Versions
## Prototype 1

Mostly just a chance to try out Bevy, try out coding some of the basics to test things out.

A chance to test out gameplay mechanics in a rough form.

**Notes**
It's probably important to finish this demo and test the global time mechanic before moving on. That being said don't both fleshing it out beyond that.


## Prototype 3
**Polish Demo**
This prototype is going to be an attempt to polish a very small section of the game.
By doing so I hope to understand deeper the direction of the game and learn what sort of changes may be needed to take it in the desired direction.
