# Place to haphazardly throw ideas and thoughts
- Learn to use states for advanced enemy ai, events for performance?
- Reorganise git repo?
- where is my next goal, should I just keep going with these micro goals?
- research various cases and their standards for where they are used
- after becoming deeply frustrated with my spiders nest of a code base I think it's time to rework from the ground up
  I shall make prototype 3 and make it neat and build it better, rather than keep pouring on features
